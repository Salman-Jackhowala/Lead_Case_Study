Lead Scoring Case Study

Industry professionals can purchase online courses from X Education, an education firm. Many experts who are interested in the courses visit their website and look through the offerings on any given day.
The business advertises its classes via a number of websites and search engines, including Google. Upon accessing the website, these individuals may peruse the available courses, complete the course registration form, or view some videos. These folks are categorised as leads when they complete a form with their phone number or email address. Additionally, the business receives leads from previous recommendations. After obtaining these leads, sales team members begin calling, emailing, and so on. Some of the leads convert during this process, but the majority do not. At X education, the lead conversion rate is typically 30%.
Few leads emerge from the bottom as paying clients, despite the fact that many are created in the first stage (top). To increase lead conversion in the intermediate stage, you must properly nurture your potential leads (i.e., educate them about the product, stay in continual communication, etc.).
You have been assigned by X Education to assist them in identifying the most promising prospectsâ€”that is, the leads with the highest likelihood of becoming paying clients. 
According to the company's requirements, you must create a model in which you give each lead a score, meaning that clients with higher lead scores are more likely to convert than those with lower scores. The intended lead conversion rate, as stated by the CEO in particular, is approximately 80%.

*	Our Case Study's Objectives:
To develop a logistic regression model that gives a score between 0 and 100 to each lead, enabling the company to target possible leads.
Additionally, you will need to take care of things so that you can adjust in the event that the needs of the organization change in the future.
The general steps are as follows:

1.	Examine and comprehend the information
2.	Clear the information
3.	Get the data ready for building the model.
4.	Construction of Models
5.	Assessment of the Model
6.	Forecasting Using the Test Set


*	Summary

In conclusion, a lot of leads are generated at the top stage, but at the bottom level, very few of those leads become paying clients. You must correctly nurture potential leads (i.e., educate them about the product, connect with them frequently, etc.) if you want to achieve a higher lead conversion rate in the middle stage.
From the leads you have created, sort the most promising leads. The most significant influences on a lead's probability of converting are "Total Visits," "Total Time Spent on Website," and "Page Views Per Visit."
Following that, you must keep a list of leads close to hand so that you can inform them of impending employment offers, new services, and prospects for higher education. Observe each lead carefully so that you can tailor the content that you send to them. Examine carefully which material, courses, or job opportunities best suit the interests of the leads. An efficient plan that outlines the requirements of every lead is necessary to convert leads into prospects.
First, think about converted leads. Meet with leads for a Q&A session to obtain the vital information you need about them. Arrange to have follow-up meetings and ask the leads follow-up questions to find out if and how they feel about taking online courses.
